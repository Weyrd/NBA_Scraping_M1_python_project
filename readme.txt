If you want to code and try somes thing, you have two solutions :

- create a new .py file in the same folder and use the .json in data
 you can import them with :
# open commonplayersinfo.json
with open("data/commonplayersinfo.json", "r") as f:
    commonplayersinfo = json.load(f)

and then i will help you after to copy your code in project.py

- try to code direcltly in project.py
you need to code between lines 118 and 140
it could be hard lol, i let an example to get the jersey numbers of ten players
